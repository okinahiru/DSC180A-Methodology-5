### Brainstorming for Quarter 2 Project Proposal

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic was learning the concepts behind graph neural networks and how they can be used.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation would involve exploring dimensionality reduction in graphs. Additionally, investigating graph-based recommendation systems for link prediction could be highly valuable, particularly for applications like congestion prediction.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I would spend more time working with additional examples to refine and better understand the application of graph neural networks.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
The techniques I would like to explore are tied to the basic concepts of chip design optimization, such as working with congestion and improving graph-based modeling approaches.
